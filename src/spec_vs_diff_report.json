  "summary": "Most core frontend requirements (routing/layout, Home sections, Collections grid + product details dialog with size selection and add-to-cart updating a header indicator, Contact form with client-side validation and success state, and a cohesive neutral fashion theme) appear implemented. The main gap is that the required generated image assets themselves are not evidenced in the diff summary. Additionally, several authentication/backend scaffolding files were added that were not requested for this marketing site scope.",

      "reason": "UI components reference the generated asset paths, but the diff summary does not show the required image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated (and omitted files are unspecified), so presence of the required assets cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
